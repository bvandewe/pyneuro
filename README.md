Neuroglia is a lightweight, opinionated framework built on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that provides a comprehensive set of tools and patterns for building clean, maintainable, and scalable microservices. It enforces architectural best practices and provides out-of-the-box implementations of common patterns.

## Why Neuroglia?

**Choose Neuroglia for complex, domain-driven microservices that need to be maintained for years to come.**

### 🎯 The Philosophy

Neuroglia believes that **software architecture matters more than speed of initial development**. While you can build APIs quickly with vanilla FastAPI or Django, Neuroglia is designed for applications that will:

- **Scale in complexity** over time with changing business requirements
- **Be maintained by teams** with varying levels of domain expertise
- **Evolve and adapt** without accumulating technical debt
- **Integrate seamlessly** with complex enterprise ecosystems

### 🏗️ When to Choose Neuroglia

| **Choose Neuroglia When**                                            | **Choose Alternatives When**                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Building **domain-rich applications** with complex business logic | ❌ Creating simple CRUD APIs or prototypes    |
| ✅ **Long-term maintenance** is a primary concern                    | ❌ You need something working "yesterday"     |
| ✅ Your team values **architectural consistency**                    | ❌ Framework learning curve is a blocker      |
| ✅ You need **enterprise patterns** (CQRS, DDD, Event Sourcing)      | ❌ Simple request-response patterns suffice   |
| ✅ **Multiple developers** will work on the codebase                 | ❌ Solo development or small, simple projects |
| ✅ Integration with **event-driven architectures**                   | ❌ Monolithic, database-first applications    |

### 🚀 The Neuroglia Advantage

**Compared to vanilla FastAPI:**

- **Enforced Structure**: No more "how should I organize this?" - clear architectural layers
- **Built-in Patterns**: CQRS, dependency injection, and event handling out of the box
- **Enterprise Ready**: Designed for complex domains, not just API endpoints

**Compared to Django:**

- **Microservice Native**: Built for distributed systems, not monolithic web apps
- **Domain-Driven**: Business logic lives in the domain layer, not mixed with web concerns
- **Modern Async**: Full async support without retrofitting legacy patterns

**Compared to Spring Boot (Java):**

- **Python Simplicity**: All the enterprise patterns without Java's verbosity
- **Lightweight**: No heavy application server - just the patterns you need
- **Developer Experience**: Pythonic APIs with comprehensive tooling

### 💡 Real-World Scenarios

**Perfect for:**

- 🏦 **Financial Services**: Complex domain rules, audit trails, event sourcing
- 🏥 **Healthcare Systems**: HIPAA compliance, complex workflows, integration needs
- 🏭 **Manufacturing**: Resource management, real-time monitoring, process orchestration
- 🛒 **E-commerce Platforms**: Order processing, inventory management, payment flows
- 🎯 **SaaS Products**: Multi-tenant architectures, feature flags, usage analytics

**Not ideal for:**

- 📝 Simple content management systems
- 🔗 Basic API proxies or data transformation services
- 📱 Mobile app backends with minimal business logic
- 🧪 Proof-of-concept or throwaway prototypes

### 🎨 The Developer Experience

Neuroglia optimizes for **code that tells a story**:

```python
# Your business logic is clear and testable
class PlaceOrderHandler(CommandHandler[PlaceOrderCommand, OperationResult[OrderDto]]):
    async def handle_async(self, command: PlaceOrderCommand) -> OperationResult[OrderDto]:
        # Domain logic is explicit and isolated
        order = Order(command.customer_id, command.items)
        await self.repository.save_async(order)
        return self.created(self.mapper.map(order, OrderDto))

# Infrastructure concerns are separated
class OrdersController(ControllerBase):
    @post("/orders", response_model=OrderDto)
    async def place_order(self, command: PlaceOrderCommand) -> OrderDto:
        return await self.mediator.execute_async(command)
```

**The result?** Code that's easy to understand, test, and evolve - even years later.

## 🎯 Architecture Overview

Neuroglia promotes a clean, layered architecture that separates concerns and makes your code more maintainable:

```text
src/
├── api/           # 🌐 API Layer (Controllers, DTOs, Routes)
├── application/   # 💼 Application Layer (Commands, Queries, Handlers, Services)
├── domain/        # 🏛️ Domain Layer (Entities, Value Objects, Business Rules)
└── integration/   # 🔌 Integration Layer (External APIs, Repositories, Infrastructure)
```
