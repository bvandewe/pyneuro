# Order View Fixes Summary

## Overview

Fixed two related issues with order views to ensure each view shows only the orders relevant to its role:

1. **Kitchen View Fix**: Filter to show only PENDING, CONFIRMED, and COOKING orders
2. **Delivery View Fix**: Show both READY and DELIVERING orders for delivery drivers

## Changes Made

### 1. Kitchen View Filter (KITCHEN_VIEW_FILTER_FIX.md)

**Problem**: Kitchen view was showing ALL active orders, including orders that were already cooked (READY) or out for delivery (DELIVERING).

**Solution**: Modified `GetActiveKitchenOrdersHandler` to filter for kitchen-specific statuses only.

**Files Modified**:

- `application/queries/get_active_kitchen_orders_query.py`

**Result**: Kitchen view now correctly shows only PENDING, CONFIRMED, and COOKING orders.

### 2. Delivery View Fix (DELIVERY_VIEW_FIX.md)

**Problem**: After the kitchen fix, READY orders disappeared from delivery view because it was using `GetReadyOrdersQuery` which only fetches READY status orders. Delivery drivers need to see both READY (available for pickup) and DELIVERING (currently out) orders.

**Solution**: Created new `GetDeliveryOrdersQuery` that fetches both READY and DELIVERING orders.

**Files Modified**:

- **Created**: `application/queries/get_delivery_orders_query.py`
- **Modified**: `ui/controllers/delivery_controller.py`
- **Modified**: `ui/templates/delivery/ready_orders.html`
- **Modified**: `application/queries/__init__.py`

**Result**: Delivery view now shows both READY and DELIVERING orders with smart sorting (delivering orders first, then ready orders in FIFO order).

## Order Status Lifecycle

```
PENDING → CONFIRMED → COOKING → READY → DELIVERING → DELIVERED
                                    ↓
                              CANCELLED (can happen at any stage)
```

## View Responsibilities Matrix

| View                           | Statuses Shown                  | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Kitchen** (`/kitchen`)       | PENDING, CONFIRMED, COOKING     | Orders requiring kitchen attention       |
| **Delivery** (`/delivery`)     | READY, DELIVERING               | Orders available for pickup + in-transit |
| **Management** (`/management`) | All except DELIVERED, CANCELLED | Complete operational overview            |

## Query Separation

### GetActiveKitchenOrdersQuery

- **Used by**: Kitchen view
- **Returns**: Orders in PENDING, CONFIRMED, COOKING status
- **Sorting**: FIFO (oldest order first)
- **Purpose**: Show orders that need kitchen preparation

### GetReadyOrdersQuery

- **Used by**: Management operations monitor
- **Returns**: Orders in READY status only
- **Sorting**: By actual_ready_time (FIFO)
- **Purpose**: Show orders available for driver assignment

### GetDeliveryOrdersQuery (NEW)

- **Used by**: Delivery driver view
- **Returns**: Orders in READY + DELIVERING status
- **Sorting**: DELIVERING first (by out_for_delivery_time), then READY (by actual_ready_time)
- **Purpose**: Show orders drivers should see (available + in-progress)

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Query-Level Filtering

Business logic about what constitutes a "kitchen order" or "delivery order" belongs in the query handler, not the repository. This keeps repositories generic and reusable.

### 2. View-Specific Queries

Each view gets its own query optimized for its specific needs rather than trying to create one-size-fits-all queries.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

- **Repository**: Generic data access (get by status, get active orders)
- **Query Handler**: View-specific business logic (what orders to show)
- **Controller**: Orchestration only (delegates to mediator)

### 4. Single Responsibility

Each query has one clear purpose:

- GetActiveKitchenOrdersQuery: "What should the kitchen see?"
- GetReadyOrdersQuery: "What orders are ready for assignment?"
- GetDeliveryOrdersQuery: "What should delivery drivers see?"

## Testing Checklist

### Kitchen View

- [ ] Shows PENDING orders waiting for confirmation
- [ ] Shows CONFIRMED orders ready to cook
- [ ] Shows COOKING orders being prepared
- [ ] Does NOT show READY orders (kitchen is done)
- [ ] Does NOT show DELIVERING orders (out with driver)
- [ ] SSE updates work in real-time

### Delivery View

- [ ] Shows READY orders waiting for pickup
- [ ] Shows DELIVERING orders currently out
- [ ] DELIVERING orders appear first in list
- [ ] READY orders sorted FIFO (oldest first)
- [ ] Does NOT show PENDING/CONFIRMED/COOKING (kitchen responsibility)
- [ ] SSE updates work in real-time

### Management View

- [ ] Shows complete overview of all active orders
- [ ] Operations monitor shows only READY orders for assignment
- [ ] Can filter by status
- [ ] SSE updates work in real-time

## Verification Results

Application logs show:

- ✅ GetDeliveryOrdersQuery successfully registered with mediator
- ✅ GetDeliveryOrdersHandler resolving correctly
- ✅ Delivery controller using new query (not GetReadyOrdersQuery)
- ✅ SSE stream working with GetDeliveryOrdersQuery
- ✅ Both manager and driver roles can access delivery view

## Next Steps

With both view filters now working correctly:

1. ✅ Kitchen view shows only kitchen-relevant orders
2. ✅ Delivery view shows both READY and DELIVERING orders
3. ⏳ Ready to proceed with Phase 2 Analytics build and testing
4. ⏳ Follow PHASE2_BUILD_TEST_GUIDE.md to complete Phase 2

## Summary

These fixes ensure proper separation of concerns where each view shows exactly the orders relevant to that role. The kitchen sees what needs cooking, delivery drivers see what needs delivery (both available and in-progress), and managers see the complete picture. This follows clean architecture principles by keeping business logic in query handlers while maintaining generic, reusable repository methods.
