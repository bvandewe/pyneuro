# Phase 2.6: Additional Analytics Queries - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Phase 2.6 is **COMPLETE**. Three additional analytics queries have been implemented, registered with the mediator, and are ready for future UI integration.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. GetOrderStatusDistributionQuery ✅

**Purpose**: Analyze order distribution across different statuses (pending, confirmed, cooking, ready, delivering, delivered, cancelled)

**File**: `application/queries/get_order_status_distribution_query.py`

**DTO**: `OrderStatusStatsDto`

- `status`: Order status name
- `count`: Number of orders in this status
- `percentage`: Percentage of total orders
- `total_revenue`: Total revenue from orders in this status

**Features**:

- Date range filtering (default: last 30 days)
- Calculates order count and revenue per status
- Computes percentage distribution
- Sorts by most common status first
- Only includes statuses with orders (excludes empty statuses)

**Use Cases**:

- Order funnel analysis
- Identify bottlenecks (high pending or cooking counts)
- Completion rate analysis
- Status-based revenue breakdown

### 2. GetOrdersByDriverQuery ✅

**Purpose**: Track delivery driver performance metrics

**File**: `application/queries/get_orders_by_driver_query.py`

**DTO**: `DriverPerformanceDto`

- `driver_id`: Delivery person ID
- `driver_name`: Driver name (currently formatted ID, ready for user lookup)
- `total_deliveries`: Number of completed deliveries
- `total_revenue`: Total revenue from delivered orders
- `average_order_value`: Average value per delivery
- `completion_rate`: Percentage of assigned orders that were delivered
- `total_assigned`: Total orders assigned (including not delivered)

**Features**:

- Date range filtering (default: last 30 days)
- Groups orders by `delivery_person_id`
- Calculates completion rate (delivered / assigned)
- Tracks revenue per driver
- Sorts by most active drivers first
- Configurable limit (default: top 10 drivers)

**Use Cases**:

- Driver performance ranking
- Identify top-performing drivers
- Completion rate monitoring
- Revenue attribution
- Driver productivity analysis

### 3. GetKitchenPerformanceQuery ✅

**Purpose**: Overall kitchen efficiency and performance metrics

**File**: `application/queries/get_kitchen_performance_query.py`

**DTO**: `KitchenPerformanceDto`

- `total_orders_cooked`: Orders that reached "ready" status
- `average_cooking_time_minutes`: Avg time from cooking_started to ready
- `orders_on_time`: Orders ready by estimated time
- `orders_late`: Orders ready after estimated time
- `on_time_percentage`: Percentage of orders ready on time
- `peak_hour`: Hour with most orders (HH:00 format)
- `peak_hour_orders`: Number of orders in peak hour
- `total_pizzas_made`: Total number of pizzas across all orders

**Features**:

- Date range filtering (default: last 30 days)
- Calculates actual cooking time (cooking_started → ready)
- Compares actual vs estimated ready times
- Identifies peak ordering hour
- Counts total pizzas produced
- Handles missing timestamps gracefully

**Use Cases**:

- Kitchen efficiency monitoring
- On-time performance tracking
- Capacity planning (peak hour analysis)
- Cooking time optimization

   - Status counting and percentage calculations
   - Revenue aggregation by status

2. **get_orders_by_driver_query.py** (130 lines)

   - Query, DTO, and Handler implementation
   - Driver performance metrics
   - Completion rate calculations

3. **get_kitchen_performance_query.py** (145 lines)
   - Query, DTO, and Handler implementation
   - Cooking time analysis
   - On-time performance calculations
   - Peak hour detection

### Files Modified

1. **application/queries/**init**.py**
   - Added imports for all 3 new queries
   - Added exports to `__all__` list
   - Query count increased from 15 to 18 handlers

```

## Data Model Compatibility

### Current Order State Support

The queries work with the existing order state fields:

**Order Tracking Fields Used**:

- `order_time`: When order was placed
- `status`: Current order status (enum)
- `delivery_person_id`: Assigned driver (for driver analytics)
- `cooking_started_time`: When cooking began
- `actual_ready_time`: When order was ready
- `estimated_ready_time`: Expected ready time
- `total_amount`: Order value
- `order_items`: List of pizzas (for counting)

**Note**: Orders don't currently track which chef prepared them. Kitchen performance is aggregate-level (overall kitchen metrics).

## Future UI Integration

These queries are ready for integration into management dashboards:

### 1. Order Status Dashboard

```json
GET /management/analytics/status-distribution?start_date=2025-10-01&end_date=2025-10-31
Response:
[
  {
    "status": "delivered",
    "count": 150,
    "percentage": 75.0,
    "total_revenue": 2250.50
  },
  {
    "status": "cancelled",
    "count": 25,
    "percentage": 12.5,
    "total_revenue": 0.0
  }
]
```

**Visualization**: Donut chart showing status distribution, table with revenue breakdown

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual API Testing

Test each query using curl or the API client:

```bash
# Status Distribution
curl "http://localhost:8000/management/analytics/status-distribution?start_date=2025-10-01&end_date=2025-10-31"

# Driver Performance
curl "http://localhost:8000/management/analytics/drivers?start_date=2025-10-01&end_date=2025-10-31&limit=5"

# Kitchen Performance
curl "http://localhost:8000/management/analytics/kitchen?start_date=2025-10-01&end_date=2025-10-31"
```

**Note**: Controller routes need to be added to expose these queries via HTTP endpoints.

### Test Scenarios

1. **Empty Date Range**: Select future dates with no orders
2. **Single Order**: Test with minimal data
3. **Large Date Range**: Test with 1 year of data
4. **Specific Status**: Check orders in each status
5. **Multiple Drivers**: Verify sorting and limit work
6. **Peak Hours**: Verify peak detection with various patterns

## Known Limitations

### Current State

- ✅ Queries implemented and registered
- ✅ DTOs defined with all required fields
- ✅ Date range filtering working
- ✅ Data aggregation logic complete
- ⏳ No HTTP endpoints yet (need controller routes)
- ⏳ No UI visualization yet (need templates/charts)
- ⏳ Driver names show formatted IDs (need user repository lookup)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Driver Name Lookup**:

   ```python
   # TODO: Integrate with user repository
   async def _get_driver_name(self, driver_id: str) -> str:
       user = await self.user_repository.get_async(driver_id)
       return user.name if user else f"Driver {driver_id}"
   ```

2. **Chef Tracking**: Add `chef_id` to Order entity

   ```python
   class OrderState:
       chef_id: Optional[str]  # Track who prepared the order
       cooking_assigned_time: Optional[datetime]
   ```

3. **Real-time Metrics**: Add SSE endpoints for live dashboard updates

4. **Export Functions**: CSV/PDF export for reports

## Integration Checklist
