## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Setup Phase

- [ ] Follow DELIVERY_KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md to configure Keycloak
- [ ] Create `delivery_driver` role
- [ ] Create `driver` test user
- [ ] Assign `delivery_driver` role to driver
- [ ] Restart application
- [ ] Logout/login to refresh session

### Access Control Testing

- [ ] Login as **customer** → Should NOT see Delivery or Kitchen links
- [ ] Login as **chef** → Should see Kitchen but NOT Delivery

- [ ] Login as **manager** → Should see BOTH Kitchen and Delivery

   - [ ] Mark as ready
   - [ ] Verify order disappears from kitchen active orders

3. **Pick Up Order (as driver)**

   - [ ] Logout and login as driver
   - [ ] Go to Delivery dashboard (`/delivery`)
   - [ ] Verify order appears in Ready Orders
   - [ ] Check customer address is displayed
   - [ ] Check waiting time is shown
   - [ ] Click "Add to My Tour"
   - [ ] Verify success message
   - [ ] Verify order disappears from Ready Orders

4. **View Delivery Tour (as driver)**

   - [ ] Verify order appears with delivery number "1"
   - [ ] Verify customer address is prominent
   - [ ] Verify "Call Customer" button works (if phone provided)
   - [ ] Verify "Open in Maps" link works
   - [ ] Verify order shows "Out for Delivery" badge with pulse animation

   - [ ] Find the order
   - [ ] Verify status shows "delivered"

### Real-Time Updates Testing

1. **Setup**

   - [ ] Open `/delivery` in one browser window as driver
   - [ ] Open `/kitchen` in another window as chef

2. **Test SSE Updates**

   - [ ] As chef, mark an order as ready
   - [ ] Verify order appears in driver's Ready Orders within 5 seconds
   - [ ] Verify connection status shows "Live Updates Active" (green)

### Multi-Driver Testing (Advanced)

- [ ] Create second driver user in Keycloak
- [ ] Login as driver1 in browser 1
- [ ] Login as driver2 in browser 2
- [ ] Create multiple ready orders
- [ ] Have driver1 pick up order A
- [ ] Have driver2 pick up order B
- [ ] Verify each driver only sees their own orders in tour
- [ ] Verify orders don't appear in each other's tours

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Try to assign already assigned order → Should show error
- [ ] Try to deliver order not in your tour → Should fail
- [ ] Create order without customer address → Should handle gracefully
- [ ] Test with order having 10+ pizzas → Should display correctly
- [ ] Test urgent orders (>15 min waiting) → Should highlight in red
- [ ] Test with no ready orders → Should show empty state message
- [ ] Test with no orders in tour → Should show empty state with link to ready orders
