## üéØ Learning Path

### Recommended Order

1. **[Getting Started](../getting-started.md)** - Understand the basics (30 min)
2. **Tutorial Parts 1-3** - Core architecture and patterns (4 hours)
3. **Tutorial Parts 4-6** - API and persistence (4 hours)
4. **Tutorial Parts 7-9** - Security and deployment (4 hours)

### Alternative Paths

**Already know Clean Architecture?**
‚Üí Skip to [Part 3: CQRS](mario-pizzeria-03-cqrs.md)

**Just want to see the code?**
‚Üí Check the [complete sample](https://github.com/bvandewe/pyneuro/tree/main/samples/mario-pizzeria)

**Need specific features?**
‚Üí Jump to relevant parts (each part is self-contained)

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Code along** - Type the examples yourself, don't just read
2. **Experiment** - Modify the code and see what happens
3. **Take breaks** - Each part takes ~1-2 hours, pace yourself
4. **Use Git** - Commit after each part to track progress
5. **Ask questions** - Open issues if something isn't clear
