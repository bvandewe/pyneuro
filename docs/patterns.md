# 🎯 Patterns and Best Practices

!!! warning "🚧 Under Construction"
This section is currently being expanded with detailed pattern implementations and Mario's Pizzeria examples. Individual pattern pages with comprehensive code examples and visual diagrams are being developed.

Software design patterns and architectural best practices demonstrated through the Neuroglia framework, with real examples from the Mario's Pizzeria sample application.

## 🏗️ Architectural Patterns

### Clean Architecture

Four-layer separation ensuring dependency inversion and testability.

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separate read and write operations for better scalability and maintainability.

### Event-Driven Architecture

Decoupled communication through domain events and CloudEvents.

### Repository Pattern

Abstract data access for testability and flexibility.

## 🎯 Domain-Driven Design Patterns

### Bounded Context

Self-contained business domains with clear boundaries.

### Aggregate Root

Consistency boundaries within the domain model.

### Domain Events

Business events raised by domain entities.

### Value Objects

Immutable objects that describe characteristics.

## 💼 Application Patterns

### Mediator Pattern

Central request/response handling through the mediator.

### Command Pattern

Encapsulate requests as objects for queuing and logging.

### Query Pattern

Optimized read operations with dedicated query models.

### Pipeline Behaviors

Cross-cutting concerns like validation and logging.

## 🔌 Integration Patterns

### Adapter Pattern

Integrate external systems through adapters.

### Anti-Corruption Layer

Protect domain models from external influence.

### Event Sourcing

Store state changes as events for auditability.

### SAGA Pattern

Manage distributed transactions across services.
