# PyNeuroctl Installation Summary

## âœ… What Has Been Created

### 1. Shell Wrapper (`/pyneuroctl`)

- **Location**: Project root - `/Users/bvandewe/Documents/Work/Systems/Mozart/src/building-blocks/Python/pyneuro/pyneuroctl`
- **Purpose**: Bash wrapper script that handles Python environment detection
- **Features**:
  - Automatic Python environment detection (venv, Poetry, pyenv, system Python)
  - Proper PYTHONPATH setup for imports
  - Error handling with helpful messages

### 2. Setup Script (`/scripts/setup/setup_pyneuroctl.sh`)

- **Location**: `scripts/setup/setup_pyneuroctl.sh`
- **Purpose**: Automated installation script that adds pyneuroctl to system PATH
- **Features**:
  - Creates `~/.local/bin/pyneuroctl` symlink
  - Adds `~/.local/bin` to PATH (if needed)
  - Shell detection (bash/zsh/etc)
  - Installation validation and testing
  - User-friendly output with emojis and colors

### 3. Legacy Support (`/scripts/setup/add_to_path.sh`)

- **Location**: `scripts/setup/add_to_path.sh`
- **Purpose**: Forwards to new setup script for backward compatibility
- **Features**: Simple forwarding with notification message

### 4. Documentation (`/scripts/setup/README.md`)

- **Location**: `scripts/setup/README.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete setup and troubleshooting guide
- **Features**: Installation instructions, manual setup, troubleshooting

## âœ… Installation Results

After running `./scripts/setup/setup_pyneuroctl.sh`:

- **Global Command**: `pyneuroctl` is now available from any directory
- **Symlink Created**: `~/.local/bin/pyneuroctl` â†’ project wrapper
- **PATH Updated**: `~/.local/bin` added to shell PATH
- **Tested Working**: All commands function properly from any directory

## âœ… Verified Functionality

**Commands tested and working:**

```bash
pyneuroctl --help                  # âœ… Shows help from any directory
pyneuroctl list                    # âœ… Lists available samples
pyneuroctl validate                # âœ… Validates sample configurations
pyneuroctl start mario-pizzeria    # âœ… Starts samples from any directory
pyneuroctl stop mario-pizzeria     # âœ… Stops samples from any directory
pyneuroctl status                  # âœ… Shows process status
pyneuroctl logs mario-pizzeria     # âœ… Shows captured logs
```

**Environment Detection:**

- âœ… Finds and uses project venv automatically
- âœ… Falls back to Poetry if available
- âœ… Handles pyenv environments
- âœ… Works with system Python as fallback

## âœ… Cross-Directory Testing

Verified that pyneuroctl works correctly when called from:

- âœ… Project root directory
- âœ… Subdirectories within project
- âœ… Completely different directories (e.g., `/tmp`)
- âœ… Home directory (`~`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

**Basic Operations:**

```bash
# From anywhere in the system:
pyneuroctl list                    # Show all available samples
pyneuroctl validate                # Check sample configurations
pyneuroctl start mario-pizzeria    # Start Mario's Pizzeria
pyneuroctl logs mario-pizzeria     # View logs
pyneuroctl stop mario-pizzeria     # Stop the sample
```

**Advanced Usage:**

```bash
pyneuroctl start mario-pizzeria --port 9000    # Custom port
pyneuroctl logs mario-pizzeria -f              # Follow logs in real-time
pyneuroctl stop --all                          # Stop all running samples
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

The wrapper uses intelligent Python detection:

1. **Local Virtual Environment** (`./venv/bin/python`) - Fastest option
2. **Poetry Environment** (`poetry run python`) - If pyproject.toml exists
3. **Pyenv Environment** (exports `PYENV_VERSION=pyneuro`)
4. **System Python** (`python3` or `python`) - Fallback

Environment variables set:

- `PYTHONPATH` includes the `src/` directory for proper imports
- Working directory is maintained correctly for relative paths

The symlink approach ensures:

- âœ… Single source of truth (wrapper script in project)
- âœ… Easy updates (changes to wrapper affect global command)
- âœ… Clean uninstall (just remove symlink)
- âœ… No PATH pollution (only `~/.local/bin` added once)

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Use

PyNeuroctl is now fully installed and ready for use! The command works from any directory and provides comprehensive sample application management for the Neuroglia Python framework.

**Next Steps:**

1. Try `pyneuroctl list` to see available samples
2. Start with `pyneuroctl validate` to check configurations
3. Launch samples with `pyneuroctl start <sample-name>`
4. Monitor with `pyneuroctl logs <sample-name>`
