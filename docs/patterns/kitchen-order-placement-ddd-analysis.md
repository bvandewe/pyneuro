# DDD Analysis: Where Should Kitchen Orders Be Added?

> **üöß Work in Progress**: This documentation is being updated to include beginner-friendly explanations with What & Why sections, Common Mistakes, and When NOT to Use guidance. The content below is accurate but will be enhanced soon.

## Question

In the Mario Pizzeria sample app, where should an order be added to the Kitchen's pending orders list:

1. **In the Command Handler** (PlaceOrderCommandHandler) - as part of the transaction?
2. **In the Domain Event Handler** (OrderConfirmedEventHandler) - as a side effect?

## Current State Analysis

### What Happens Now

**PlaceOrderCommandHandler Flow:**

```python
async def handle_async(self, request: PlaceOrderCommand):
    # 1. Create or get customer
    customer = await self._create_or_get_customer(request)

    # 2. Create order with items
    order = Order(customer_id=customer.id())
    order.add_order_item(...)

    # 3. Confirm order (raises OrderConfirmedEvent)
    order.confirm_order()

    # 4. Save order
    await self.order_repository.add_async(order)

    # 5. Register for domain event dispatching
    self.unit_of_work.register_aggregate(order)

    # ‚ùå Kitchen is NOT updated here

    return self.created(order_dto)
```

**StartCookingCommandHandler Flow:**

```python
async def handle_async(self, request: StartCookingCommand):
    # 1. Get order and kitchen
    order = await self.order_repository.get_async(request.order_id)
    kitchen = await self.kitchen_repository.get_kitchen_state_async()

    # 2. Check capacity
    if kitchen.is_at_capacity:
        return self.bad_request("Kitchen is at capacity")

    # 3. Start cooking
    order.start_cooking()  # Raises CookingStartedEvent
    kitchen.start_order(order.id())  # ‚úÖ Kitchen updated in command handler

    # 4. Save both aggregates
    await self.order_repository.update_async(order)
    await self.kitchen_repository.update_kitchen_state_async(kitchen)

    # 5. Register for events
    self.unit_of_work.register_aggregate(order)

    return self.ok(order_dto)
```

**Key Observation:** The `StartCookingCommandHandler` updates the Kitchen **in the command handler**, not in an event handler.

## DDD Principles Analysis

### 1. Aggregate Boundaries

**Order Aggregate:**

- Root: `Order`
- Owns: `OrderItems` (value objects)
- Responsible for: Order lifecycle, business rules about items, pricing

**Kitchen Aggregate:**

- Root: `Kitchen`
- Owns: `active_orders` list (order IDs)
- Responsible for: Capacity management, tracking orders in preparation

**Customer Aggregate:**

- Root: `Customer`
- Responsible for: Customer information, contact details

**These are SEPARATE aggregates** - they should maintain their own consistency boundaries.

### 2. Transaction Boundaries

**DDD Rule:** A transaction should modify **at most ONE aggregate root**.

**Why?**

- Ensures clear consistency boundaries
- Prevents distributed transaction complexity
- Makes concurrency control manageable
- Maintains aggregate autonomy

**Application to Pizza Domain:**

#### Scenario A: Update Kitchen in Command Handler

```python
async def handle_async(self, request: PlaceOrderCommand):
    # Transaction modifies TWO aggregates:
    order = Order(...)
    order.confirm_order()
    await self.order_repository.add_async(order)  # Aggregate 1

    kitchen = await self.kitchen_repository.get_kitchen_state_async()
    kitchen.add_pending_order(order.id())
    await self.kitchen_repository.update_kitchen_state_async(kitchen)  # Aggregate 2

    # ‚ùå VIOLATES: One transaction, two aggregates
```

**Problems:**

- ‚ùå Violates single aggregate per transaction rule
- ‚ùå Tight coupling between Order and Kitchen
- ‚ùå If Kitchen update fails, what happens to Order?
- ‚ùå Concurrency issues if multiple orders placed simultaneously
- ‚ùå Kitchen becomes a bottleneck for order placement

#### Scenario B: Update Kitchen in Event Handler (Eventually Consistent)

```python
# Command Handler - modifies ONE aggregate
async def handle_async(self, request: PlaceOrderCommand):
    order = Order(...)
    order.confirm_order()  # Raises OrderConfirmedEvent
    await self.order_repository.add_async(order)
    self.unit_of_work.register_aggregate(order)
    # ‚úÖ Transaction complete, only modified Order
    return self.created(order_dto)

# Event Handler - separate transaction, different aggregate
class OrderConfirmedEventHandler:
    async def handle_async(self, event: OrderConfirmedEvent):
        kitchen = await self.kitchen_repository.get_kitchen_state_async()
        kitchen.add_pending_order(event.aggregate_id)
        await self.kitchen_repository.update_kitchen_state_async(kitchen)
        # ‚úÖ Separate transaction, only modified Kitchen
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Each transaction modifies ONE aggregate
- ‚úÖ Loose coupling via events
- ‚úÖ Order placement succeeds independently
- ‚úÖ Better scalability and concurrency
- ‚úÖ Clearer failure boundaries

### 3. Domain Event Semantics

**What is OrderConfirmedEvent?**

- **Past tense** - something that ALREADY happened
- **Immutable fact** - the order WAS confirmed
- **Publishing contract** - "I'm telling you this happened, do what you need to do"

**Event Handler Responsibilities:**

- React to domain events from other aggregates
- Implement **inter-aggregate workflows**
- Maintain **eventual consistency** between aggregates
- Handle **side effects** and **projections**

### 4. Consistency Models

**Strong Consistency (Single Aggregate):**

```
Order.confirm_order() ‚Üí Order.state.status = CONFIRMED
                      ‚Üí Order.state.confirmed_time = now()
‚úÖ Immediate consistency within Order aggregate
```

**Eventual Consistency (Cross-Aggregate):**

```
Order confirms ‚Üí OrderConfirmedEvent published
              ‚Üì
              ‚Üí Event dispatched (after transaction commits)
              ‚Üì
              ‚Üí OrderConfirmedEventHandler invoked
              ‚Üì
              ‚Üí Kitchen updated with new pending order

‚úÖ Eventually consistent between Order and Kitchen
```

### 5. Business Rules Analysis

**Question:** Is "Kitchen must know about confirmed orders" a business invariant or a side effect?

**Business Invariant** (must be enforced in transaction):

- "Order must have at least one pizza"
- "Order total must be >= 0"
- "Kitchen cannot exceed max capacity when starting cooking"
- **These must be checked BEFORE committing**

**Side Effect / Eventual Consistency** (can happen after transaction):

- "Kitchen should track pending orders for dashboard"
- "Customer should receive confirmation email"
- "Analytics should update order metrics"
- **These can happen asynchronously**

**Analysis for Pizzeria:**

The Kitchen tracking pending orders is **NOT a business invariant for order placement**. Here's why:

1. **Order can be placed even if Kitchen is busy** - the order goes into "confirmed" state, waiting for kitchen capacity
2. **Kitchen tracking is for operational visibility** - showing what orders are waiting
3. **Failure to update Kitchen doesn't invalidate the Order** - the order is still valid
4. **Kitchen state is a projection/read model** - derived from order events

**Counterpoint:** When **starting cooking** (StartCookingCommand), Kitchen capacity IS a business rule:

```python
if kitchen.is_at_capacity:
    return self.bad_request("Kitchen is at capacity")
```

This must be checked in the transaction because it affects whether the order can transition to "Cooking" state.

## Recommendation: Use Event Handler (Eventually Consistent)

### ‚úÖ Recommended Approach

**Update the Kitchen via OrderConfirmedEventHandler:**

```python
# domain/entities/kitchen.py
class Kitchen(Entity[str]):
    def __init__(self, max_concurrent_orders: int = 3):
        super().__init__()
        self.id = "kitchen"
        self.active_orders: list[str] = []  # Orders being cooked
        self.pending_orders: list[str] = []  # Orders confirmed, waiting to cook
        self.max_concurrent_orders = max_concurrent_orders
        self.total_orders_processed = 0

    def add_pending_order(self, order_id: str) -> None:
        """Add a confirmed order to the pending queue"""
        if order_id not in self.pending_orders:
            self.pending_orders.append(order_id)

    def start_order(self, order_id: str) -> bool:
        """Move order from pending to active (if capacity allows)"""
        if self.is_at_capacity:
            return False

        # Remove from pending if present
        if order_id in self.pending_orders:
            self.pending_orders.remove(order_id)

        # Add to active
        if order_id not in self.active_orders:
            self.active_orders.append(order_id)

        return True
```

```python
# application/event_handlers.py
class OrderConfirmedEventHandler(DomainEventHandler[OrderConfirmedEvent]):
    """Handles order confirmation - adds to kitchen pending queue"""

    def __init__(self, kitchen_repository: IKitchenRepository):
        self.kitchen_repository = kitchen_repository

    async def handle_async(self, event: OrderConfirmedEvent) -> Any:
        """Process order confirmed event"""
        logger.info(
            f"üçï Order {event.aggregate_id} confirmed! "
            f"Total: ${event.total_amount}, Pizzas: {event.pizza_count}"
        )

        # Update kitchen with pending order
        kitchen = await self.kitchen_repository.get_kitchen_state_async()
        kitchen.add_pending_order(event.aggregate_id)
        await self.kitchen_repository.update_kitchen_state_async(kitchen)

        # Other side effects:
        # - Send SMS notification to customer
        # - Send email receipt
        # - Update kitchen display system
        # - Create kitchen ticket

        return None
```

```python
# application/commands/place_order_command.py
class PlaceOrderCommandHandler(CommandHandler[PlaceOrderCommand, OperationResult[OrderDto]]):
    async def handle_async(self, request: PlaceOrderCommand) -> OperationResult[OrderDto]:
        try:
            # Create customer and order (ONE aggregate modified)
            customer = await self._create_or_get_customer(request)
            order = Order(customer_id=customer.id())

            # Add items
            for pizza_item in request.pizzas:
                order_item = OrderItem(...)
                order.add_order_item(order_item)

            # Confirm order (raises OrderConfirmedEvent)
            order.confirm_order()

            # Save order (commits transaction)
            await self.order_repository.add_async(order)

            # Register for domain event dispatching
            self.unit_of_work.register_aggregate(order)
            self.unit_of_work.register_aggregate(customer)

            # ‚úÖ Kitchen will be updated by OrderConfirmedEventHandler
            # ‚úÖ Happens AFTER this transaction commits
            # ‚úÖ Eventually consistent

            return self.created(order_dto)

        except Exception as e:
            return self.bad_request(f"Failed to place order: {str(e)}")
```

### Why This is Better

#### 1. **Respects Aggregate Boundaries**

- PlaceOrderCommand modifies only Order aggregate ‚úÖ
- OrderConfirmedEventHandler modifies only Kitchen aggregate ‚úÖ
- Each transaction touches ONE aggregate root ‚úÖ

#### 2. **Follows Event-Driven Architecture**

- Domain events communicate between aggregates ‚úÖ
- Loose coupling between Order and Kitchen ‚úÖ
- Easy to add new event handlers (email, SMS, analytics) ‚úÖ

#### 3. **Better Scalability**

```
Without Event Handler (Synchronous):
PlaceOrder ‚Üí Update Order ‚Üí Update Kitchen ‚Üí Commit
             |______________|______________|
                 Single Transaction
                 Kitchen is bottleneck

With Event Handler (Asynchronous):
PlaceOrder ‚Üí Update Order ‚Üí Commit ‚úÖ (fast)
                          ‚Üì
                          Event Published
                          ‚Üì
                          ‚Üí Update Kitchen ‚úÖ (separate transaction)
                          ‚Üí Send Email ‚úÖ
                          ‚Üí Update Analytics ‚úÖ
```

#### 4. **Clearer Failure Handling**

- Order placement **succeeds** even if Kitchen update temporarily fails
- Event handler can **retry** Kitchen update independently
- Kitchen update failure doesn't rollback the order (order is still valid)
- Eventual consistency is acceptable for this use case

#### 5. **Business Semantics Match Reality**

Real pizza shop flow:

1. Customer places order ‚Üí **Order confirmed** ‚úÖ
2. Order ticket goes to kitchen ‚Üí **Kitchen gets notification** ‚úÖ
3. Kitchen starts when ready ‚Üí **Order moves to cooking** ‚úÖ

The kitchen getting the ticket is a **consequence** of order confirmation, not a prerequisite.

#### 6. **Consistency with StartCookingCommand**

Notice that `StartCookingCommand` DOES update Kitchen in the handler:

```python
kitchen.start_order(order.id())  # Check capacity + update kitchen
order.start_cooking()  # Update order status
```

**Why is this different?**

- **Kitchen capacity is a business rule** for starting cooking
- Must be checked atomically to prevent race conditions
- If capacity check fails, order cannot start cooking
- **Strong consistency required** between Kitchen and Order for this operation

**But for PlaceOrder:**

- Kitchen tracking confirmed orders is just **visibility/monitoring**
- Order can be confirmed regardless of kitchen state
- **Eventual consistency is acceptable**

---

## Common Objections Addressed

### Objection 1: "But kitchen update might fail!"

**Response:**

- That's OK - the Order is still valid and confirmed
- Event handlers can **retry** on failure
- Use outbox pattern or reliable event bus for guaranteed delivery
- Kitchen can poll for confirmed orders as backup
- This is **eventual consistency** - the system will become consistent

### Objection 2: "What if we need to know kitchen state before confirming?"

**Response:**

- Then that's a different requirement: "Order placement should check kitchen capacity"
- In that case, add a **query before the command**:

```python
# In controller or application service
kitchen = await query_handler.execute(GetKitchenStatusQuery())
if kitchen.pending_orders_count >= MAX_PENDING:
    return self.bad_request("Too many pending orders")

# Proceed with PlaceOrderCommand
result = await mediator.execute(PlaceOrderCommand(...))
```

- Still don't couple Order and Kitchen aggregates in the same transaction
- Pre-check is for **user experience**, not **transactional consistency**

### Objection 3: "Eventual consistency is complex!"

**Response:**

- It's actually **simpler** than distributed transactions
- The framework handles event dispatching automatically
- No distributed locks or 2-phase commits needed
- Better scalability and resilience
- This is how most successful systems work (Amazon, Netflix, Uber)

## Implementation Checklist

To implement this recommendation:

1. ‚úÖ **Add `pending_orders` to Kitchen entity**

   ```python
   self.pending_orders: list[str] = []
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Add `add_pending_order()` method to Kitchen**

   ```python
   def add_pending_order(self, order_id: str) -> None
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Update `start_order()` to move from pending to active**

   ```python
   def start_order(self, order_id: str) -> bool:
       if order_id in self.pending_orders:
           self.pending_orders.remove(order_id)
       self.active_orders.append(order_id)
   ```

4. ‚úÖ **Update OrderConfirmedEventHandler**

   ```python
   kitchen = await self.kitchen_repository.get_kitchen_state_async()
   kitchen.add_pending_order(event.aggregate_id)
   await self.kitchen_repository.update_kitchen_state_async(kitchen)
   ```

5. ‚úÖ **Keep PlaceOrderCommandHandler as-is**

   - No kitchen updates in command handler
   - Only modifies Order aggregate

6. ‚úÖ **Update KitchenStatusDto to show pending orders**

   ```python
   pending_orders: list[str]
   ```

---

## Conclusion

**Recommendation: Add orders to Kitchen in the OrderConfirmedEventHandler** ‚úÖ

This approach:

- ‚úÖ Follows DDD aggregate boundary rules (one aggregate per transaction)
- ‚úÖ Uses domain events correctly (inter-aggregate communication)
- ‚úÖ Provides eventual consistency (acceptable for this use case)
- ‚úÖ Maintains loose coupling (easy to extend)
- ‚úÖ Scales better (no transaction bottleneck)
- ‚úÖ Matches real-world semantics (order confirmed ‚Üí kitchen notified)
- ‚úÖ Handles failures gracefully (order valid even if kitchen update fails)

**The current StartCookingCommand is correct** because kitchen capacity is a **business invariant** that must be checked atomically when transitioning to cooking state.

**Your intuition about transactions was correct**, but the key insight is: **Not everything needs strong consistency**. Kitchen tracking confirmed orders is a **projection/read model** that can be eventually consistent, while kitchen capacity for cooking is a **business rule** that requires strong consistency.

This is a fundamental DDD pattern: **Strong consistency within aggregates, eventual consistency between aggregates.**
