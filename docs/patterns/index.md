# 🎯 Architecture Patterns

Architecture patterns form the foundation of maintainable, scalable software systems. The Neuroglia framework implements and promotes proven architectural patterns that support clean code principles, testability, and long-term maintainability.

## 🏛️ Core Architectural Patterns

**What You'll Learn:**

- Four-layer architecture implementation
- Dependency flow and injection patterns
- Domain entity design with business logic
- Integration layer abstraction

### [📡 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)](cqrs.md)

Separates read and write operations for optimal performance and scalability. Demonstrates command handlers for writes and query handlers for optimized reads.

**Key Concepts:**

- Command/Query separation
- Optimized read models
- Write model integrity
- Performance optimization

**What You'll Learn:**

- Command and query pattern implementation
- Handler-based request processing
- Read model optimization strategies
- Event integration with CQRS

### [🔄 Event-Driven Architecture](event-driven.md)

Implements reactive systems using domain events and event handlers. Shows how to build loosely coupled systems that respond to business events.

**Key Concepts:**

- Domain event patterns
- Event handlers and workflows
- Asynchronous processing
- System decoupling

**What You'll Learn:**

- Domain event design and publishing
- Event handler implementation
- Kitchen workflow automation
- CloudEvents integration

### [💾 Repository Pattern](repository.md)

Abstracts data access logic with multiple storage implementations. Demonstrates file-based, MongoDB, and in-memory repositories with consistent interfaces.

**Key Concepts:**

- Data access abstraction
- Storage implementation flexibility
- Consistent query interfaces
- Testing with mock repositories

**What You'll Learn:**

- Repository interface design
- Multiple storage backend implementation
- Async data access patterns
- Repository testing strategies

### [🌐 Resource-Oriented Architecture](resource-oriented-architecture.md)

Resource-oriented design principles for building RESTful APIs and resource-centric applications. Focuses on identifying resources, defining operations, and implementing HTTP-based interactions.

**Key Concepts:**

- Resource identification and modeling
- RESTful API design principles
- HTTP verb mapping and semantics
- Resource lifecycle management

**What You'll Learn:**

- Resource-oriented design principles
- RESTful API architecture patterns
- HTTP protocol integration
- Resource state management

### [👀 Watcher & Reconciliation Patterns](watcher-reconciliation-patterns.md)

Kubernetes-inspired patterns for watching resource changes and implementing reconciliation loops. Essential for building reactive systems and operators.

**Key Concepts:**

- Resource state observation
- Reconciliation loop patterns
- Event-driven state management
- Declarative resource management

**What You'll Learn:**

- Resource watching implementation
- Reconciliation loop design
- Event-driven update patterns
- State synchronization strategies

### [⚡ Watcher & Reconciliation Execution](watcher-reconciliation-execution.md)

Execution engine for watcher and reconciliation patterns with support for error handling, retries, and monitoring.

**Key Concepts:**

- Execution orchestration
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance monitoring
- Reliable state persistence

**What You'll Learn:**

- Execution pipeline design
- Error handling strategies
- Monitoring and observability
- Performance optimization

## 🍕 Mario's Pizzeria: Unified Example

All patterns use **Mario's Pizzeria** as a consistent domain example, showing how patterns work together in a real-world system:
