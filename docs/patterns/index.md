# 🎯 Architecture Patterns

Architecture patterns form the foundation of maintainable, scalable software systems. The Neuroglia framework implements and promotes proven architectural patterns that support clean code principles, testability, and long-term maintainability.

## �️ Architectural Approaches: A Comparative Introduction

Before diving into specific patterns, it's essential to understand the different architectural philosophies that drive modern system design. The Neuroglia framework draws from multiple architectural approaches, each with distinct strengths and use cases.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy Comparison

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Declarative Resource-Oriented Architecture** represent two powerful but different approaches to managing complex system states:

- **DDD**: Models systems around business domains, focusing on _behavior_ and _state transitions_
- **Declarative Architecture**: Defines _desired end states_ and uses automated processes to achieve them

### 🔄 Architectural Patterns Overview

| Architecture                         | Core Philosophy                                                                          | Primary Actor                                                                                         | Unit of Work                                                                   | Source of Truth                                                           | Flow of Logic                                                                                                                         | Error Handling                                                                  | Typical Domain                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **🏛️ Domain-Driven Design**          | Model around business domain with **AggregateRoot** as guardian enforcing business rules | **Imperative Command**: User/system issues explicit commands (`AddToppingToPizza`)                    | **Aggregate**: Boundary around business objects with atomic transactions       | **Application Database**: Current aggregate state in database             | **Synchronous & Explicit**: `CommandHandler` → `Repository.Get()` → `Aggregate.Method()` → `Repository.Update()`                      | **Throws Exceptions**: Business rule violations cause immediate failures        | **Complex Business Logic**: E-commerce, banking, booking systems               |
| **🌐 Declarative Resource-Oriented** | Define **desired state** and let automated processes achieve it                          | **Declarative Reconciliation**: Automated **Controller** continuously matches actual to desired state | **Resource**: Self-contained state declaration (e.g., Kubernetes Pod manifest) | **Declarative Manifest**: Configuration file (YAML) defines desired state | **Asynchronous & Looping**: `Watcher` detects change → `Controller` triggers → **Reconciliation Loop** → `Client.UpdateActualState()` | **Retries and Converges**: Failed operations retry in next reconciliation cycle | **Infrastructure & Systems Management**: Kubernetes, Terraform, CloudFormation |

### 🎨 Practical Analogies

- **DDD** is like **giving a chef specific recipe instructions**: "Add 20g of cheese to the pizza" - explicit commands executed immediately
- **Declarative Architecture** is like **giving the chef a photograph of the final pizza**: "Make it look like this" - continuous checking and adjustment until the goal is achieved

### 📡 Event-Driven Architecture: The Foundation

**Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** serves as the **postal service** 📬 of your system - a foundational pattern enabling reactive communication without tight coupling between components.

#### 🏛️ EDA in Domain-Driven Design

In DDD, EDA handles **side effects** and communication between different business domains (Bounded Contexts):

- **Purpose**: Reacting to **significant business moments**
- **Mechanism**: `AggregateRoot` publishes **`DomainEvents`** (e.g., `OrderPaid`, `PizzaBaked`)
- **Benefit**: Highly decoupled systems where services don't need direct knowledge of each other

**Example**: `Orders` service publishes `OrderPaid` → `Kitchen` service receives event and starts pizza preparation

#### 🌐 EDA in Declarative Architecture

In declarative systems, EDA powers the **reconciliation loop**:

- **Purpose**: Reacting to **changes in configuration or state**
- **Mechanism**: **Watcher** monitors resources → generates events → **Controller** consumes events and reconciles state
- **Benefit**: Automated state management with continuous convergence toward desired state

**Example**: YAML file creates `Deployment` → API server generates "resource created" event → Deployment controller creates required pods

### 🔄 Integration Summary

| Architecture                    | How it uses Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **🏛️ Domain-Driven Design**     | Uses **Domain Events** to announce significant business actions, triggering workflows in decoupled business domains                  |
| **🌐 Declarative Architecture** | Uses **State Change Events** (from watchers) to trigger controller reconciliation loops, ensuring actual state matches desired state |

### 🎯 Choosing Your Approach

Both patterns leverage EDA for reactive, decoupled systems but differ in **event nature and granularity**:

- **DDD**: Focus on high-level business events with rich domain behavior
- **Declarative**: Focus on low-level resource state changes with automated convergence

The Neuroglia framework provides implementations for both approaches, allowing you to choose the right pattern for each part of your system.
