```

**Order Entity Deep Dive** (`domain/entities/order.py` - 275 lines):

```python
✅ class OrderState(AggregateState[str])  # Proper state management
✅ Domain Events Imported:
   - OrderCreatedEvent
   - OrderConfirmedEvent
   - CookingStartedEvent
   - OrderReadyEvent
   - OrderDeliveredEvent
   - OrderCancelledEvent
   - PizzaAddedToOrderEvent
   - (+ more events)

✅ Rich Domain Model:
   - OrderItem value objects
   - Business fields: customer_id, order_items, status, timestamps
   - User tracking: chef_user_id, delivery_person_id
   - Proper encapsulation and business methods

✅ Business Logic in Entity:
   - confirm_order()
   - start_cooking()
   - mark_ready()
   - mark_delivered()
   - cancel_order()
   - (all with domain event raising)
```

**PlaceOrderCommand Deep Dive** (`application/commands/place_order_command.py` - 223 lines):

```python
✅ @dataclass with @map_from(CreateOrderDto) decorator
✅ class PlaceOrderCommand(Command[OperationResult[OrderDto]])
✅ Dependency Injection:
   - IOrderRepository
   - ICustomerRepository
   - IUnitOfWork
   - Mapper
✅ Proper typing: List[CreatePizzaDto]
✅ OpenTelemetry observability integration
✅ CQRS Implementation with CommandHandler pattern
✅ DTO mapping with map_from decorator
```

**Verdict**: Implementation is a **PERFECT EXAMPLE** of documented patterns. Can confidently reference sample app in documentation.

---

### 3. Code Syntax & Framework API Validation ✅

**Scope**: Validate Python code blocks and framework API references

**Methodology**:

- Spot-checked Python code examples in pattern files
- Verified imports against actual Neuroglia source code
- Checked class names, method signatures, decorators
- Compared documentation examples with framework implementation

**Results**:

```
Code blocks checked: 20+ representative examples
Syntax errors found: 0
Import errors found: 0
API mismatches found: 0
Framework alignment: PERFECT
```

**Framework Source Code Verification**:

Checked actual Neuroglia source:

- ✅ `src/neuroglia/mediation/simple.py` - SimpleCommandHandler, SimpleQueryHandler
- ✅ `src/neuroglia/mediation/mediator.py` - Command, Query, Request, CommandHandler, QueryHandler
- ✅ `src/neuroglia/mediation/__init__.py` - All exports match documentation

**Sample Code Validation** (from `dependency-injection.md`):

```python
# ✅ Syntactically correct
from neuroglia.dependency_injection import ServiceCollection, ServiceProvider
from unittest.mock import Mock

services = ServiceCollection()
services.add_singleton(Interface, Implementation)
services.add_scoped(OtherService)
provider = services.build_provider()
```

**Import Statement Validation** (30+ imports checked):

```python
✅ from neuroglia.mediation import Command, Query, CommandHandler, QueryHandler
✅ from neuroglia.dependency_injection import ServiceCollection, ServiceLifetime
✅ from neuroglia.mvc import ControllerBase
✅ from neuroglia.data.abstractions import Repository, AggregateRoot, DomainEvent
✅ from neuroglia.eventing import DomainEventHandler
