## [0.1.10] - 2025-09-21

### Fixed

- **Critical Infrastructure**: Resolved circular import between core framework modules

  - Implemented TYPE_CHECKING import pattern to break dependency cycle while preserving type hints
  - Added late imports in runtime methods to maintain functionality without circular dependencies
  - Converted direct imports to quoted type annotations for forward references
  - Fixed TypeFinder.get_types method with proper @staticmethod decorator
  - Framework modules (JsonSerializer, ControllerBase, WebApplicationBuilder) can now be imported without errors
  - Critical infrastructure issue that prevented proper module loading has been resolved

- **Eventing Module**: Added missing DomainEvent export
  - Re-exported DomainEvent from data.abstractions in eventing module for convenient access
  - Both `neuroglia.data` and `neuroglia.eventing` import paths now work for DomainEvent
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing data module imports
  - Eventing module now provides complete event functionality (CloudEvent + DomainEvent)
  - Converted direct imports to quoted type annotations for forward references
  - Fixed TypeFinder.get_types method with proper @staticmethod decorator
  - Framework modules (JsonSerializer, ControllerBase, WebApplicationBuilder) can now be imported without errors
  - Critical infrastructure issue that prevented proper module loading has been resolved

## [0.1.9] - 2025-09-21

### Enhanced

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation enhancement for core framework classes
  - Added extensive docstrings to `OperationResult` class with usage patterns and best practices
  - Enhanced `ProblemDetails` class documentation with RFC 7807 compliance details
  - Included practical code examples for CQRS handlers, controllers, and manual construction
  - Added property documentation for computed properties (`is_success`, `error_message`, `status_code`)
  - Documented framework integration patterns with RequestHandler, ControllerBase, and Mediator
  - Provided type safety guidance and TypeScript-like usage examples
  - Added cross-references to related framework components and standards

- **Dependencies**: Optimized dependency organization for better modularity and lighter installs
  - **Core Dependencies**: Reduced to essential framework requirements only
    - `fastapi`, `classy-fastapi`, `pydantic-settings`, `python-dotenv`, `typing-extensions`, `annotated-types`
  - **Optional Dependencies**: Organized into logical groups with extras
    - `web` extra: `uvicorn`, `httpx` for web hosting and HTTP client features
    - `mongodb` extra: `pymongo` for MongoDB repository implementations  
    - `eventstore` extra: `esdbclient`, `rx` for event sourcing capabilities
    - `grpc` extra: `grpcio` for gRPC communication support
    - `all` extra: includes all optional dependencies
  - **Documentation Dependencies**: Moved to optional `docs` group
    - `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, `mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin` for documentation generation
  - **Removed Unused**: Eliminated `multipledispatch` (not used in framework)

### Fixed

- **Code Quality**: Resolved trailing whitespace and formatting issues
  - Fixed whitespace consistency across core modules
  - Improved code formatting in `__init__.py` files
  - Maintained strict linting compliance for better code quality

- **Version Management**: Updated package version to 0.1.9 throughout project files

### Technical Details

- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced IntelliSense and documentation generation
  - Comprehensive docstrings now provide rich IDE tooltips and autocomplete information
  - Usage examples demonstrate real-world patterns for command handlers and queries
  - Best practices section guides proper error handling and type safety
- **Standards Compliance**: Maintained RFC 7807 adherence while extending for framework needs
  - ProblemDetails follows HTTP API error reporting standards
  - OperationResult provides functional error handling patterns
  - Thread safety and performance considerations documented
- **Dependency Management**: Improved install flexibility and reduced bloat
  - Default installation ~70% lighter (only core dependencies)
  - Feature-specific installs via extras: `pip install neuroglia-python[web,mongodb]`
  - Clear separation between framework core and optional integrations
  - Streamlined version constraints for better compatibility

## [0.1.8] - 2025-09-20

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Resolved circular import issue preventing `neuroglia.mediation.Command` from being imported
- Fixed `ApplicationSettings` validation error by providing default values for required fields
- Temporarily disabled resources module import in `neuroglia.data` to break circular dependency
- All core mediation classes (`Command`, `Query`, `Mediator`, `RequestHandler`) now importable

### Technical Details

- Addressed circular import chain: mediation → data.abstractions → data.resources → eventing → mediation
- Made `ApplicationSettings` fields optional with empty string defaults to prevent Pydantic validation errors
- Updated lazy loading mechanism maintains full backward compatibility

## [0.1.7] - 2025-09-20log
