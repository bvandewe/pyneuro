## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.7] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `AsyncCacheRepository.get_all_by_pattern_async()` deserialization error

  - **Problem**: Pattern-based queries failed with `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'`

    - Redis client may return strings (when `decode_responses=True`) or bytes (when `decode_responses=False`)
    - `_search_by_key_pattern_async()` was returning data as-is from Redis without normalizing the type
    - When Redis returned strings, the code expected bytes and failed during deserialization
    - Caused cascade failures in event-driven workflows relying on pattern searches

  - **Solution**: Normalize entity data to bytes in `_search_by_key_pattern_async()`

    - Added type check: if `entity_data` is `str`, encode to bytes (`entity_data.encode("utf-8")`)
    - Ensures consistent data type returned regardless of Redis client configuration
    - Existing decode logic in `get_all_by_pattern_async()` handles bytes correctly

  - **Impact**:

    - Pattern searches now work with both `decode_responses=True` and `decode_responses=False`
    - Prevents production failures in event processing that relies on cache pattern queries
    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code expecting bytes

  - **Files Changed**: `neuroglia/integration/cache_repository.py` line 263-267

  - **Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite `test_cache_repository_pattern_search_fix.py`
    - Tests both string and bytes responses from Redis
    - Validates handling of mixed responses
    - Tests complex real-world patterns from production
    - Verifies error handling and filtering

### Technical Details

- **Root Cause**: Modern `redis-py` (v5.x) defaults to `decode_responses=True` for Python 3 compatibility
- **Compatibility**: Fix works with both old (`decode_responses=False`) and new (`decode_responses=True`) Redis client configurations
- **Data Flow**:
  1. Redis client returns data (str or bytes depending on configuration)
  2. `_search_by_key_pattern_async()` normalizes to bytes (NEW)
  3. `get_all_by_pattern_async()` decodes bytes to string
  4. Serializer receives consistent string input

## [0.4.6] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed transient service resolution in scoped contexts

  - **Problem**: Transient services (like notification handlers) were built from root provider, preventing them from accessing scoped dependencies
  - **Solution**: Modified `ServiceScope.get_services()` to build transient services within scope context using `self._build_service(descriptor)`
  - **Impact**: Enables event-driven architecture where transient handlers can depend on scoped repositories
  - Resolves issue: "Scoped Services Cannot Be Resolved in Event Handlers"

- **Async Scope Disposal**: Added proper async disposal support for scoped services
  - Added `ServiceScope.dispose_async()` method for async resource cleanup
  - Calls `__aexit__()` for async context managers
  - Falls back to `__exit__()` for sync context managers
  - Also invokes `dispose()` method if present for explicit cleanup
  - Ensures proper resource cleanup after event processing, even in error scenarios

### Added

- `ServiceProviderBase.create_async_scope()` - Async context manager for scoped service resolution

  - Creates isolated scope per event/operation (similar to HTTP request scopes)
  - Automatic resource disposal on scope exit
  - Essential for event-driven architectures with scoped dependencies

- `Mediator.publish_async()` now creates async scope per notification

  - All notification handlers execute within same isolated scope
  - Handlers can depend on scoped services (repositories, UnitOfWork, DbContext)
  - Automatic scope disposal after all handlers complete

- Comprehensive test suite: `test_mediator_scoped_notification_handlers.py`
  - 10 tests covering scoped service resolution in event handlers
  - Tests for service isolation, sharing, disposal, and error handling
  - Validates backward compatibility with non-scoped handlers

### Technical Details

- **Service Lifetime Handling in Scopes**:

  - Singleton services: Retrieved from root provider (cached globally)
  - Scoped services: Built and cached within scope
  - Transient services: Built fresh in scope context (can access scoped dependencies)

- **Event-Driven Pattern Support**:
  - Each `CloudEvent` processed in isolated async scope
  - Scoped repositories shared across handlers for same event
  - Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks

## [0.4.5] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed

- **CacheRepository Parameterization**: `AsyncCacheRepository.configure()` now registers parameterized singleton services
  - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Changed from non-parameterized to parameterized service registration
  - **Problem**: All entity types shared the same `CacheRepositoryOptions` and `CacheClientPool` instances
    - DI container couldn't distinguish between `CacheRepositoryOptions[User, str]` and `CacheRepositoryOptions[Order, int]`
    - Potential cache collisions between different entity types
    - Lost type safety benefits of generic repository pattern
  - **Solution**: Register type-specific singleton instances
    - `CacheRepositoryOptions[entity_type, key_type]` for each entity type
    - `CacheClientPool[entity_type, key_type]` for each entity type
    - DI container now resolves cache services independently per entity type
  - **Benefits**:
    - Type-safe cache resolution per entity type
    - Prevents cache collisions between different entity types
    - Full generic type support in DI container
    - Each entity gets dedicated cache configuration
  - **Requires**: neuroglia v0.4.3+ with type variable substitution support

### Added

- Comprehensive documentation: `notes/STRING_ANNOTATIONS_EXPLAINED.md`
  - Explains string annotations (forward references) in Python type hints
  - Details circular import prevention strategy
  - Shows impact of PEP 563 and `get_type_hints()` usage
  - Real-world Neuroglia framework examples
  - Best practices for using string annotations

### Changed

- Enhanced logging in `CacheRepository.configure()` to show entity and key types
  - Now logs: `"Redis cache repository configured for User[str] at localhost:6379"`
  - Helps debug multi-entity cache configurations

## [0.4.4] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed string annotation (forward reference) resolution in DI container

  - DI container now properly resolves `"ClassName"` annotations to actual classes
  - Fixed crash with `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '__name__'`
  - Affects AsyncCacheRepository and services using `from __future__ import annotations`
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 6 new tests

- Enhanced error message generation to handle all annotation types safely

  - String annotations (forward references)
  - Types without **name** attribute (typing constructs)
  - Regular types

- Updated CacheRepository to use parameterized types (v0.4.3)
  - CacheRepositoryOptions[TEntity, TKey]
  - CacheClientPool[TEntity, TKey]
  - Full type safety with type variable substitution

### Added

- Comprehensive test suite for string annotation handling
- Documentation for string annotation bug fix

## [0.4.3] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed

- **Type Variable Substitution in Generic Dependencies**: Enhanced DI container to properly substitute type variables in constructor parameters

  - **Problem**: Constructor parameters with type variables (e.g., `options: CacheRepositoryOptions[TEntity, TKey]`) were not being substituted with concrete types
    - When building `AsyncCacheRepository[MozartSession, str]`, parameters with `TEntity` and `TKey` were used as-is
    - DI container looked for `CacheRepositoryOptions[TEntity, TKey]` instead of `CacheRepositoryOptions[MozartSession, str]`
    - Service resolution failed with "cannot resolve service 'CacheRepositoryOptions'"
  - **Root Cause**: v0.4.2 fixed parameter resolution but didn't call `TypeExtensions._substitute_generic_arguments()`
    - Comment claimed "TypeVar substitution is handled by get_generic_arguments()" but wasn't actually performed
    - The substitution logic existed but wasn't being used at the critical point
  - **Solution**: Added type variable substitution in `_build_service()` methods
    - Both `ServiceScope._build_service()` and `ServiceProvider._build_service()` now call `TypeExtensions._substitute_generic_arguments()`
    - Type variables in constructor parameters are replaced with concrete types from service registration
    - Example: `CacheRepositoryOptions[TEntity, TKey]` â†’ `CacheRepositoryOptions[MozartSession, str]`
  - **Impact**: Constructor parameters can now use type variables that match the service's generic parameters
    - Repositories with parameterized dependencies work correctly
    - Complex generic dependency graphs resolve properly
    - Type safety maintained throughout dependency injection
  - **Affected Scenarios**: Services with constructor parameters using type variables
    - `AsyncCacheRepository(options: CacheRepositoryOptions[TEntity, TKey])` pattern now works
    - Multiple parameterized dependencies in single constructor
    - Nested generic types with type variable substitution
  - **Migration**: No code changes required - enhancement enables previously failing patterns
  - **Testing**: Added 6 comprehensive test cases in `tests/cases/test_type_variable_substitution.py`

## [0.4.2] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed

- **Generic Type Resolution in Dependency Injection**: Fixed critical bug preventing resolution of parameterized generic types

  - **Root Cause**: `ServiceScope._build_service()` and `ServiceProvider._build_service()` attempted to reconstruct generic types by calling `__getitem__()` on origin class:
    - Tried `init_arg.annotation.__origin__.__getitem__(args)` which failed
    - `__origin__` returns the base class, not a generic alias
    - Classes don't have `__getitem__` unless explicitly defined
    - Manual reconstruction was unnecessary - annotation already properly parameterized
  - **Error**: `AttributeError: type object 'AsyncStringCacheRepository' has no attribute '__getitem__'`
  - **Solution**: Replaced manual reconstruction with Python's official typing utilities
    - Imported `get_origin()` and `get_args()` from typing module
    - Use annotation directly when it's a parameterized generic type
    - Simpler, more robust, standards-compliant approach
  - **Impact**: Generic types now resolve correctly in DI container
    - Services can depend on `Repository[User, int]` style types
    - Event handlers with multiple generic repositories work
    - Query handlers can access generic data access layers
    - Full CQRS pattern support with generic infrastructure
  - **Affected Scenarios**: All services depending on parameterized generic classes
    - Event handlers depending on generic repositories
    - Query handlers depending on generic data access layers
    - Any CQRS pattern implementation using generic infrastructure
  - **Migration**: No code changes required - bug fix makes existing patterns work
  - **Documentation**: Added comprehensive fix guide in `docs/fixes/GENERIC_TYPE_RESOLUTION_FIX.md`
  - **Testing**: Added 8 comprehensive test cases covering all scenarios

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed

- **Controller Routing Fix**: Fixed critical bug preventing controllers from mounting to FastAPI application

  - **Root Cause**: `WebHostBase.use_controllers()` had multiple bugs:
    - Instantiated controllers without dependency injection (`controller_type()` instead of retrieving from DI)
    - Called non-existent `get_route_prefix()` method on controller instances
    - Used incorrect `self.mount()` method instead of `self.include_router()`
  - **Solution - use_controllers() Rewrite**: Complete rewrite of controller mounting logic
    - Retrieves properly initialized controller instances from DI container via `services.get_services(ControllerBase)`
    - Accesses existing `controller.router` attribute (from Routable base class)
    - Uses correct FastAPI `include_router()` API with `/api` prefix
  - **Solution - Auto-Mounting Feature**: Enhanced `WebApplicationBuilder.build()` method
    - Added `auto_mount_controllers=True` parameter (default enabled)
    - Automatically calls `host.use_controllers()` during build process
    - 99% of use cases now work without manual mounting step
    - Optional manual control available by setting parameter to False
  - **Impact**: Controllers now properly mount to FastAPI application with all routes accessible
    - Swagger UI at `/api/docs` now shows all controller endpoints
    - OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json` properly populated
    - API endpoints return 200 responses instead of 404 errors
  - **Migration**: No breaking changes - existing code continues to work, but explicit `use_controllers()` calls are now optional
  - **Documentation**: Added comprehensive fix guide and troubleshooting documentation in `docs/fixes/`
  - **Testing**: Added test suite validating DI registration, route mounting, and HTTP endpoint accessibility
