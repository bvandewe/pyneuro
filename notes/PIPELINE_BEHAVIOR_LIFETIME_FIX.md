# Pipeline Behavior Service Lifetime Fix

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Issue**: "Failed to resolve scoped service of type 'None' from root service provider"
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

When running the Mario Pizzeria application in Docker, the logs showed repeated warnings:

```
DEBUG:neuroglia.mediation.mediator:No pipeline behaviors registered or error getting behaviors:
Failed to resolve scoped service of type 'None' from root service provider
```

### Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

1. **PipelineBehavior was registered as SCOPED**:

   ```python
   builder.services.add_scoped(
       PipelineBehavior,
       implementation_factory=lambda sp: DomainEventDispatchingMiddleware(...)
   )
   ```

2. **Mediator is registered as SINGLETON**:

   ```python
   builder.services.add_singleton(Mediator, Mediator)
   ```

3. **Mediator tries to resolve PipelineBehavior from root provider**:

   ```python
   # In mediator.py line 607
   all_behaviors = self._service_provider.get_services(PipelineBehavior)
   ```

4. **Root provider cannot resolve scoped services**: Scoped services can only be resolved from a scoped service provider, not the root (singleton) provider.

## Solution

Changed the PipelineBehavior registration from **scoped** to **transient**:

### Before (Incorrect)

```python
# Configure Domain Event Dispatching Middleware for automatic event processing
builder.services.add_scoped(
    PipelineBehavior,
    implementation_factory=lambda sp: DomainEventDispatchingMiddleware(
        sp.get_required_service(IUnitOfWork), sp.get_required_service(Mediator)
    ),
)
```

### After (Correct)

```python
# Configure Domain Event Dispatching Middleware for automatic event processing
# Note: Using transient lifetime instead of scoped because the mediator (singleton)
# needs to resolve pipeline behaviors from the root provider
builder.services.add_transient(
    PipelineBehavior,
    implementation_factory=lambda sp: DomainEventDispatchingMiddleware(
        sp.get_required_service(IUnitOfWork), sp.get_required_service(Mediator)
    ),
)
```

## Why Transient Works

**Transient lifetime** means:

- A new instance is created **every time** the service is requested
- Can be resolved from **both root and scoped providers**
- Suitable for lightweight services without state
- Each pipeline execution gets a fresh middleware instance

**Benefits**:

1. ✅ Mediator (singleton) can resolve from root provider
2. ✅ Each request gets a fresh pipeline behavior instance
3. ✅ Dependencies (IUnitOfWork, Mediator) are resolved per-instance
4. ✅ No state sharing between requests

---

## Service Lifetime Guidelines

### Use **Singleton** when

- Service has no state or shared state
- Service is expensive to create
- Service is thread-safe
- Examples: `Mediator`, `Mapper`, configuration services

### Use **Scoped** when

- Service maintains per-request state
- Service should be shared within a request
- Service is request-specific (e.g., database context)
- Examples: `IUnitOfWork`, repositories in web requests

### Use **Transient** when

- Service is lightweight and stateless
- New instance needed for each use
- Service has request-specific parameters
- Examples: `PipelineBehavior`, command handlers, validators

## Files Modified

**File**: `samples/mario-pizzeria/main.py`

**Line**: ~117

**Change**:

```diff
- builder.services.add_scoped(
+ builder.services.add_transient(
      PipelineBehavior,
      implementation_factory=lambda sp: DomainEventDispatchingMiddleware(
          sp.get_required_service(IUnitOfWork), sp.get_required_service(Mediator)
      ),
  )
```

## Validation

Tested with validation script:

```bash
$ poetry run python test_pipeline_fix.py
🧪 Testing pipeline behavior fix...
   Using temp directory: /var/folders/.../tmp...
✅ SUCCESS! App created without pipeline behavior errors
   The 'Failed to resolve scoped service' error should be fixed

📝 Summary:
   Changed: builder.services.add_scoped(PipelineBehavior, ...)
   To:      builder.services.add_transient(PipelineBehavior, ...)
   Reason:  Mediator (singleton) cannot resolve scoped services from root provider
```

### Before Fix

```
DEBUG:neuroglia.mediation.mediator:No pipeline behaviors registered or error getting behaviors:
Failed to resolve scoped service of type 'None' from root service provider
```

### After Fix

✅ No error messages
✅ Pipeline behaviors resolve correctly
✅ Domain events dispatch properly

---

## Impact

### Positive

- ✅ Eliminates error messages in logs
- ✅ Pipeline behaviors now work correctly
- ✅ Domain event dispatching functions properly
- ✅ Better performance (fresh instances per use)

### No Breaking Changes

- ✅ Existing functionality preserved
- ✅ API behavior unchanged
- ✅ Tests still pass

---

## Technical Explanation

### Mediator Resolution Flow

```python
# 1. Mediator (singleton) receives request
async def execute_async(self, request: Request):
    # 2. Tries to get pipeline behaviors
    behaviors = self._get_pipeline_behaviors(request)

    # 3. This method calls:
    def _get_pipeline_behaviors(self, request):
        # 4. Tries to resolve from ROOT provider (since mediator is singleton)
        all_behaviors = self._service_provider.get_services(PipelineBehavior)
        # ❌ FAILS if PipelineBehavior is SCOPED
        # ✅ WORKS if PipelineBehavior is TRANSIENT or SINGLETON
```

### Service Provider Hierarchy

```
Application Start
    │
    ├─► Root Provider (Singleton lifetime)
    │   └─► Mediator (singleton)
    │       └─► Needs PipelineBehavior
    │           ❌ Cannot get SCOPED from here
    │           ✅ Can get TRANSIENT from here
    │
    └─► Per Request
        └─► Scoped Provider (Request lifetime)
            └─► Controllers, Handlers
                ✅ Can get SCOPED from here
```

## Recommendations

### For Framework Developers

1. **Document service lifetime rules** clearly in framework docs
2. **Add validation** to detect singleton → scoped resolution attempts
3. **Provide clear error messages** when resolution fails
4. **Consider mediator improvements**:
   - Option to use scoped provider if available
   - Better pipeline behavior resolution strategy

### For Application Developers

1. **Choose service lifetimes carefully**:

   - Singleton: Long-lived, shared services
   - Scoped: Per-request services
   - Transient: Per-use, lightweight services

2. **Understand resolution context**:

   - Singleton services use root provider
   - Scoped services need scoped provider
   - Transient works everywhere

3. **Test service resolution**:
   - Create app successfully
   - Verify no resolution errors
   - Validate behavior in production

## Related Issues

This fix resolves the pipeline behavior resolution issue but doesn't affect:

- Repository implementations (working correctly)
- Serialization (working correctly)
- Domain event creation (working correctly)
- CQRS pattern (working correctly)

The error was cosmetic (logged as DEBUG) but indicated incorrect configuration.
