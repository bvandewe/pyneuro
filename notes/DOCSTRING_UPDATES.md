## üìù Usage Notes

1. **Maintain Formatting**: Keep exact indentation and spacing
2. **Quote Style**: Use triple double quotes `"""` for all docstrings
3. **Link Accuracy**: Ensure all URLs point to the correct MkDocs pages
4. **Class Context**: Place docstrings immediately after the class definition line
5. **Module Docstrings**: Place at the very top of the file, after imports
