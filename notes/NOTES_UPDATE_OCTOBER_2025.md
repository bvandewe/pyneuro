  - Updated framework code references
  - Testing results and backward compatibility notes
  - Complete status of all completed work

#### `/architecture/hosting_architecture.md`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive hosting system architecture reference
- **Content**:
  - Component hierarchy and design principles
  - WebApplicationBuilder simple vs advanced modes
  - Host types (WebHost vs EnhancedWebHost)
  - Controller registration patterns
  - Lifecycle management
  - Dependency injection integration
  - Exception handling architecture
  - Configuration management
  - Multi-app architecture patterns
  - Observability integration
  - Type system documentation
  - Best practices and troubleshooting

### 2. Documents Moved to Proper Locations

#### To `/migrations/` (Historical/Archive)

- `APPLICATION_BUILDER_ARCHITECTURE_UNIFICATION_PLAN.md` - Original planning document (archived)
- `NOTES_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` - Previous organization plan (archived)
- `NOTES_ORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md` - Previous organization completion (archived)

#### To `/observability/`

- `FASTAPI_MULTI_APP_INSTRUMENTATION_FIX.md` - OpenTelemetry multi-app fix
- `OTEL_MULTI_APP_QUICK_REF.md` - OpenTelemetry quick reference

### 3. Documents Updated

#### `/notes/README.md`

- **Updates**:
  - Added references to new hosting architecture document
  - Added APPLICATION_BUILDER_UNIFICATION_COMPLETE.md to framework section
  - Added "Recent Updates (October 2025)" section
  - Documented WebApplicationBuilder unification
  - Updated directory structure descriptions
  - Added public documentation link

## Content Accuracy

### Framework Implementation Status

All notes accurately reflect:

✅ **WebApplicationBuilder Unification**

- Single builder class with simple/advanced modes
- Automatic mode detection based on app_settings
- Backward compatibility via EnhancedWebApplicationBuilder alias
- Type-safe with Union[ApplicationSettings, ApplicationSettingsWithObservability]

✅ **Module Structure**

- `enhanced_web_application_builder.py` removed
- All functionality in `web.py`
- Alias in `__init__.py` for backward compatibility

✅ **Host Types**

- WebHost for simple scenarios
- EnhancedWebHost for advanced scenarios
- Automatic instantiation based on configuration

✅ **Type System**

- Proper Union types (not Any)
- Forward references for circular import avoidance
- ApplicationSettings and ApplicationSettingsWithObservability support

✅ **Test Status**

- 41/48 tests passing
- 7 failures are pre-existing async setup issues
- No test regressions from unification

### Documentation Alignment

All notes are aligned with:

✅ **Current Codebase** (October 25, 2025)

- Reflects actual implementation in src/neuroglia/hosting/
- Code examples are tested and working
- Type annotations match implementation

✅ **API Surface**

- All public methods documented
- Parameters and return types accurate
- Usage examples verified

✅ **Architecture**

- Component relationships documented
- Design patterns explained
- Best practices reflect real-world usage

## Notes Quality Standards

### 1. Implementation Documents

- **Status**: Clearly marked (Complete/In Progress/Planned)
- **Date**: Include completion/update dates
- **References**: Link to related documents
- **Code Examples**: Tested and working
- **Migration Paths**: Clear before/after examples

### 2. Architecture Documents

- **Diagrams**: ASCII art or Mermaid syntax
- **Components**: Clear hierarchy and relationships
- **Patterns**: Explained with rationale
- **Examples**: Realistic usage scenarios
- **Best Practices**: Based on real implementation

### 3. Reference Documents

- **Accuracy**: Match current implementation
- **Completeness**: Cover all major features
- **Organization**: Logical flow and structure
- **Maintenance**: Update dates and status

## Usage for Public Documentation
