# Version Attribute Update Summary

## Issue Identified

The `__version__` attribute in `src/neuroglia/__init__.py` was not updated during the v0.4.3 release.

## What Was Fixed

- ✅ Updated `src/neuroglia/__init__.py` from `__version__ = "0.1.8"` to `__version__ = "0.4.3"`
- ✅ Committed change to GitHub
- ✅ Pushed to main branch

## Current Status

### GitHub Repository (✅ CORRECT)

```python
# src/neuroglia/__init__.py
__version__ = "0.4.3"  # ✅ Correct
```

### PyPI Package v0.4.3 (⚠️ OUTDATED - Cannot Fix)

The v0.4.3 package already published to PyPI contains:

```python
# src/neuroglia/__init__.py
__version__ = "0.1.8"  # ⚠️ Outdated (from when it was built)
```

**Why can't we fix it?**

- PyPI does not allow re-uploading the same version
- The package metadata (version in `pyproject.toml`) is correct and shows "0.4.3"
- Only the internal `__version__` attribute in the code is outdated

## Impact Assessment

### Minimal Impact ✅

**Package metadata is correct:**

```bash
$ pip show neuroglia-python
Name: neuroglia-python
Version: 0.4.3  # ✅ Correct
```

**Only runtime attribute is affected:**

```python
import neuroglia
print(neuroglia.__version__)  # Will print "0.1.8" for PyPI package
```

**Most users won't notice because:**

1. Package installers (pip, poetry) use the metadata version (correct)
2. Dependency specifications work correctly (`neuroglia-python>=0.4.3`)
3. Runtime version checks are uncommon
4. All functionality is correct - only the version string is wrong

### Who Might Be Affected

**Rare edge cases:**

- Scripts that programmatically check `neuroglia.__version__`
- Debug logs that include the runtime version
- Support tools that report the version

**Workaround:**

```python
# Instead of:
import neuroglia
version = neuroglia.__version__  # Returns "0.1.8" (wrong)

# Use:
import importlib.metadata
version = importlib.metadata.version('neuroglia-python')  # Returns "0.4.3" (correct)
```

## Resolution Plan

### Option 1: Fix in Next Release (RECOMMENDED)

- Wait for next feature/fix
- Release as v0.4.4 or v0.5.0 with correct `__version__`
- Note in CHANGELOG that v0.4.3 PyPI package had incorrect internal version

### Option 2: Immediate Patch Release

- Release v0.4.4 immediately with only the `__version__` fix
- CHANGELOG: "Fixed internal **version** attribute to match package version"
- Minimal overhead but creates version churn

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1** - Fix in next release:

- The issue has minimal practical impact
- Creates less confusion than releasing v0.4.4 for just a version string
- All functionality is correct
- Users can use `importlib.metadata.version()` if needed

## Lessons Learned

### For Future Releases

**ALWAYS update ALL version locations:**

1. ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Package metadata version
2. ✅ `src/neuroglia/__init__.py` - Runtime `__version__` attribute
3. ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Version entry

**Checklist added to:**

- `notes/VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md` - Comprehensive version management guide
- Includes pre-commit hook to prevent version mismatches

## Verification

### Current GitHub State (Correct)

```bash
$ git show HEAD:src/neuroglia/__init__.py | grep __version__
__version__ = "0.4.3"  # ✅
```

### Future Installations

Any future release will have the correct version, as the GitHub repository is now correct.

## Action Items

- [x] Update `src/neuroglia/__init__.py` to "0.4.3"
- [x] Commit and push to GitHub
- [x] Document the issue
- [x] Create version management checklist
- [ ] Fix in next release (v0.4.4 or later)

## Summary

The `__version__` attribute is now correctly set to "0.4.3" in the GitHub repository. The PyPI package for v0.4.3 contains the old value but this has minimal practical impact since package metadata is correct. The issue will be fully resolved in the next release.
